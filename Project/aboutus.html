            <p id = about-us>Crunch Labs was founded by an ambitious 18-year-old from New Jersey who
                transformed a personal passion into a vision. Growing up, he realized the importance
                of fitness, not just for physical health but for overall mental well-being.
                Motivated by his own journey to overcome challenges and embrace an active lifestyle,
                he decided to create accessible workout plans for people of all fitness levels.
                The journey started small—creating routines for friends and family—but soon grew into
                a bigger mission to help others take charge of their health. Today,
                over 60% of adults don't get enough physical activity, and Crunch Labs aims to
                change that by providing effective, easy-to-follow plans for everyone.

            <h3 id = "about-us-subheader-2">Mission</h3>
            <p id = mission>
                Crunch Labs aims to inspire and motivate people to lead healthier lives through simple,
                effective workout routines. Our mission is to break down barriers to fitness by offering
                workout plans that are approachable, flexible, and tailored to individual needs.
                Studies show that regular physical activity can improve mood, increase energy levels,
                and even extend life expectancy. At Crunch Labs, we want to make these benefits
                accessible to everyone, regardless of experience. By making fitness easy to start
                and rewarding to continue, we hope to create a community of individuals who feel
                empowered, confident, and capable of achieving their health goals.
